## Relay and Bulb Connections

### 1. ESP32 to Relay Module

| Relay module pin | ESP32 connection |
|---|---|
| IN1 | GPIO 26 |
| VCC | Compatible supply specified for the relay module |
| GND | ESP32 GND |
| IN2 | Not connected |

The program assumes an **active-low relay module**: LOW activates the relay, and HIGH deactivates it. Confirm this behavior for your module.

### 2. Relay Contacts to Bulb Circuit

The intended circuit uses the relay to switch the bulb's live conductor.

| Connection | Purpose |
|---|---|
| AC live (red) → COM | Supplies the relay's common contact |
| NO → bulb live (red) | Feeds the bulb when the relay activates |
| Bulb neutral → AC neutral (blue) | Completes the bulb's supply circuit |
| NC | Unused |

**COM (Common):** The relay's common switching contact.

**NO (Normally Open):** Disconnected from COM while the relay is inactive; connects to COM when the relay activates.

**NC (Normally Closed):** Connected to COM while the relay is inactive; normally unused for this switching arrangement.

### 3. System Operation

1. At startup, the relay command is OFF.
2. An authorized teacher scans their RFID card.
3. The ESP32 activates the relay, connecting COM to NO, and the bulb turns ON.
4. The next authorized scan deactivates the relay, disconnecting COM from NO, and the bulb turns OFF.
5. Unauthorized cards do not change the relay state.

### 4. Electrical Requirements

- Use a relay rated for the bulb's voltage, current, and load type.
- Keep low-voltage ESP32 wiring separate from AC wiring.
- Ensure mains wiring is properly insulated and enclosed.
- Never use a breadboard for mains voltage.
- Verify terminal markings and have the complete mains circuit checked before energizing it.
